# Cyber Security Paper: Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

This project focuses on detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using machine learning models. We leverage the PyCaret library to automate the process of model selection, creation, tuning, and evaluation. Additionally, we implement data encryption and decryption using the Fernet algorithm for added security.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques to detect and classify Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on network systems. DoS attacks are a critical threat to network availability and security, where malicious actors attempt to disrupt legitimate access to services or resources.

In addition to developing robust machine learning models for attack detection, this project integrates data encryption and decryption using the Fernet algorithm to safeguard sensitive information within the dataset. Encryption ensures that data remains secure during storage and transmission, while decryption allows authorized access for analysis and model training.

## Data Acquisition

The dataset employed in this project comprises various network traffic features and attributes essential for training and evaluating machine learning models. Data acquisition involves loading and preprocessing these datasets to ensure they are suitable for model training.
